My name is Michał. I am someone who enjoys learning new things. By profession, I am a ship mechanic and graduated from a naval school. I accidentally started learning programming when I became curious about how computer games were created. The first language I learned was C++, but I realized I wanted to see my work in a browser window, so I became interested in front-end development.

I have no commercial experience; I am a self-taught developer who has been learning programming since 2020. I have mainly worked with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Angular.

Besides programming, I am also self-taught in construction and have been building a house with the help of tutorials. I handle tasks related to electricity, mechanics, plumbing, and all kinds of renovations and minor repairs.

As a hobby, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and learning about different cultures. I am always open to learning new things. I guess that’s all!
